<h1>Student Education Rights</h1>
<h2>Hi! My name is Astha Munot!</h2>
<p>So, I bet all of you reading this passage have most probably gotten an education. <br>
    and I can totally relate, i have also gotten an education, and thats probably the <br>
    reason why I am writing this website. In fact, its not just you and me who have gotten <br> 
    an education, but another 1 million children go to school each school day, and learn many new things.<br>
    And that huge number, no doubt. But, is it enough? Factually, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents <br> 
    around the world are unable to reach minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics,<br>  
    even though two thirds of them are in school. And the reasons are they cannot afford to go to school, have to help <br>
    their parents at home to keep the family running, etc. Ultimately, I feel this is a very harsh social crisis <br> 
    that people should need to be aware of. Just think of all of the children, and adolescents that are not being <br>
    able to get a good education just because of their financial and social status.
